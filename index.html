<!-- This accompanies the dataRet.js file as my solution to question 3.
  I have an extension in Visual Studio Code which opens a live server on .html files and that's how
  I host my solution.
  I understand that implementing the solution in this way isn't what I should be doing since I can't return values
  under certain scenarios described in the question. [See dataRes.js for more]
